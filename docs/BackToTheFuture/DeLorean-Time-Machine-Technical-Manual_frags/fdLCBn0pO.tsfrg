A non-responsive DeLorean — intriguing, if vexing! Power is the lifeblood of this beast, requiring precisely 1.21 gigawatts to initiate the flux capacitor’s quantum tunneling effect. Inspect the plutonium-fueled nuclear microreactor ( aft of the passenger compartment, shielded in lead casing). Depleted rods emit a faint 511 keV gamma signature — verify with a Geiger counter. If you’ve retrofitted Mr. Fusion (post-2015 upgrade), ensure the cold fusion chamber isn’t choked with high-entropy debris — say, organic particulates exceeding 0.5 kg. A failure here halts the system’s bootstrap sequence. Let’s refine the hypothesis.
