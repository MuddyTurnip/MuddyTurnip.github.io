Eureka — or rather, elementary! Your energy source is deficient. The microreactor demands 239Pu rods enriched to 94% — a single rod yields 1.21 GW for approximately 10^6 seconds of operation (assuming negligible decay losses). If depleted, source a replacement via isotopic separation — mind the legalities, lest you tangle with 1985’s authorities! For Mr. Fusion, input a heterogeneous mass of carbonaceous waste; its proton-proton chain sustains a 10^9 K plasma. Re-engage the ignition coil (rated 12V, 40A); you’ll detect a 60 Hz oscillation as the flux capacitor primes. Equilibrium restored — your Nobel awaits!
