Power flows at 1.21 GW, yet the system’s inert — confounding! Direct your attention to the flux capacitor, a toroidal array of yttrium-barium-copper-oxide superconductors encased in borosilicate glass, positioned dorsal to the cabin. It should emit a 450 nm photon flux (orange hue) at 2 Hz, indicative of Cooper pair resonance. A dark or erratic output suggests thermal overload — perhaps a surge exceeding 10^12 joules. Replace it with a spare (stored in the trunk, tolerances ±0.01 mm). If it’s operational, suspect a causality violation in the spacetime manifold.
