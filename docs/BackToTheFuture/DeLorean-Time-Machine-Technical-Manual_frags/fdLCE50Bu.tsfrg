Manifold’s pristine, yet we’re immobilized — extraordinary! A chroniton dampening field, likely from a future custodial agency, is neutralizing our displacement vector. Scan the console for a 10 Hz strobe (code ‘TP-88’); it’s their quantum signature. Counteract with my override algorithm: input 1985-10-26 (base-10 epoch key) to disrupt their entanglement lock. A 0.1 s latency precedes freedom — evade their notice, or we’ll be debating ethics in a 22nd-century courtroom!
