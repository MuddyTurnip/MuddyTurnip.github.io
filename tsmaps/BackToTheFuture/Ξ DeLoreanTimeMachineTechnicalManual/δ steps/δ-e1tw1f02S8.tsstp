The flux capacitor’s kaput — a scientific tragedy! This device modulates a 10^14 Hz electromagnetic field to breach the Planck epoch threshold. Failure — likely from dielectric breakdown — renders temporal displacement impossible. Extract the damaged unit (mass 4.2 kg, beware residual 300°C surfaces) and install a duplicate from the reserve cache. Recalibrate to 1.21 GW input; you’ll observe a Lorentzian pulse as spacetime yields. Operational integrity restored — your colleagues will be agog at your ingenuity!
