Obstructed injector — elementary physics! This conduit sustains a 10^8 Pa pressure gradient; occlusion throttles the neutron flux below criticality. Flush with citric acid (50 mL, 298 K) to dissolve PuO₂ precipitates — ventilate, lest you inhale a 5 Sv dose! Reinitialize the system; a 120 dB resonance signals restored flow. At 88 mph, you’ll traverse the Minkowski continuum. A triumph of applied thermodynamics — publishable, I daresay!
