Time circuits are impeccable, yet we’re temporally becalmed — curious! Inspect the plutonium injector manifold (316L steel, 0.8 m length), channeling 10^17 neutrons/s to the reactor core. A blockage — crystallized Pu-239 oxide, perhaps — drops efficiency below 85%. Purge it with a 0.1 M citric acid rinse (pH 2.5). If unobstructed, hypothesize an exogenous field — possibly a tachyon suppression grid from a regulatory body circa 2100. One final probe to resolve this!
