A computational error — how pedestrian! The time circuits demand precision: DESTINATION TIME (target), PRESENT TIME (origin), LAST TIME DEPARTED (reference). An input like ‘Feb 30, 1985’ or a latitude beyond ±90° locks the system in a null state. Reprogram to a viable tensor — say, 1985-10-26, 01:35:00 PST, 34.107°N, 117.647°W. Initiate at 88 mph (39.3 m/s); the resulting 10^15 erg shockwave confirms success. Precision, my peers, is the bedrock of chronodynamics!
