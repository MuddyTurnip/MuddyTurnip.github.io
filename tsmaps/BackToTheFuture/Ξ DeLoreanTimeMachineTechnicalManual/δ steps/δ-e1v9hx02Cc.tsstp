Compromised dispersal unit — predictable wear! This disc stabilizes the wormhole aperture; a 0.1 mm eccentricity scatters us across eons. Replace it (torque to 15 Nm); the new unit’s 10^8 S/m conductivity restores coherence. At 88 mph, a 10^12 W/m² flux confirms success — you’ll land on target. A testament to materials science — submit this to *Physical Review Letters* posthaste!
