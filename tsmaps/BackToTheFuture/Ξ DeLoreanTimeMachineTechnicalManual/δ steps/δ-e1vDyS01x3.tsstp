Turbulence in the spacetime continuum — exhilarating chaos! The dispersal unit’s sound, but a 10^-43 s variance in the metric tensor deflects us. Mid-transit, adjust the inertial dampeners (gain +0.05, 10 ms response) to counter a 10^5 m/s² shear. Stability returns with a 0.01 g jitter — your arrival is assured. You’ve navigated a quantum maelstrom — worthy of a symposium keynote!
