Flux capacitor’s nominal, yet she’s static — great Scott, a paradox! If you’ve recently traversed your own worldline, you may have induced a Gödelian closed timelike curve. Inspect the onboard chronometer: erratic data (e.g., null entropy readings) or a fading personal artifact signals self-annihilation. Engage the emergency reset actuator (unmarked, ventral to the console, 5 Nm torque); it reinitializes the quantum state vector. Success hinges on Heisenberg uncertainty — your existence is now a probability function. Fascinating, no?
