She’s breaching time, but landing awry — 1885 instead of 1985? Remarkable! Recalibrate the time circuits: DESTINATION TIME must align with your intent (e.g., 2015-10-21, 37.774°N, 122.419°W). A ±0.001° error equates to a 111 km deviation — check your trigonometry! If accurate, the flux dispersal unit (a 50 mm beryllium disc) may be misaligned, or we’re contending with a Kerr metric perturbation from a proximal singularity. Let’s rectify this deviation.
