# Back to the Future

*The DeLorean from **Back to the Future** is a sleek, quirky time machine disguised as a car that’s equal parts cool and kooky. Built from a DMC-12, it’s got that iconic wedge-shaped design with sharp angles, a stainless-steel body that gleams like a retro-futuristic dream, and those unmistakable gull-wing doors that scream "look at me." Its silver finish gives it a timeless, almost alien vibe, but it’s also a bit of a diva—prone to quirks like a dodgy flux capacitor or a temperamental time circuit.*{: .grey}

*Inside, it’s a chaotic jumble of 1980s tech meets mad-scientist chic: think blinking LEDs, tangled wires, and a dashboard plastered with analogue gauges and digital readouts that belong in a B-movie spaceship. The heart of it all is the flux capacitor, glowing and humming as it powers the car to 88 mph for time jumps, leaving fiery trails in its wake. It’s not just a vehicle — it’s a character, unreliable yet heroic, as likely to stall in 1955 as it is to save the day. Equal parts rockstar and rustbucket, it’s the ultimate ride for anyone chasing adventure across time.*{: .grey}
