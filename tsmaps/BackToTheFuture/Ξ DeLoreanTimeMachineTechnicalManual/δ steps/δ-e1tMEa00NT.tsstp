Greetings, fellow seeker of knowledge! I am Dr. Emmett L. Brown, Ph.D., inventor of the world’s first functional temporal displacement device: the DeLorean DMC-12 Time Machine. If you’ve unearthed this manual, you’ve likely acquired my prototype — perhaps from a scrapyard in 1985 or a cave in 1885. Congratulations on your find! Alas, if she’s not piercing the Einsteinian fabric at 88 miles per hour, we’ve got a conundrum. This guide assumes familiarity with quantum electrodynamics and a tolerance for my… unorthodox methods. Let’s diagnose the anomaly — whether it’s a power deficit, a temporal misfire, or a navigational drift. What’s the primary malfunction?
