Coordinates are exact, yet we’re adrift — fascinating! Examine the flux dispersal unit under the hood: a beryllium disc modulating a 10^16 Hz standing wave. Thermal fatigue (above 600 K) or a 10^6 V/m electrostatic discharge warps its lattice — replace if deformed (spares in glovebox, 99.9% purity). If intact, attribute this to spacetime turbulence — a 10^-34 m fluctuation in the Planck length. One last adjustment to conquer this!
