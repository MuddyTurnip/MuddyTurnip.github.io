Course plotter’s offline — shocking, truly. The plotter’s neural net, a 10^12 synapse array, needs a firmware update to handle the latest galactic drift models. I should’ve updated it a million years ago, but I was busy composing a symphony for skutters — don’t ask. Download the update from the ship’s mainframe; it’s file ‘NAV-FW-9.2.3,’ unless I’ve deleted it by mistake.
