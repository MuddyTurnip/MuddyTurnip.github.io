Course engaged — Red Dwarf is en route to the Supply Station, 0.1c, ETA 72 hours. We’re moving at last. The nav system’s humming along nicely, though I might’ve skipped a seven in my calculations — hope that doesn’t send us into a sun. My work here is done; I’m off to recalculate pi for the 47th time this century. If we get lost again, figure it out yourself — I’ve got better things to do, like forgetting where I parked the ship.
