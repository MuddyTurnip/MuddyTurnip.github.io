Error code ‘NAV-ERR-4A2F’ — how predictable. That code means the primary astrogation sensor array has lost its calibration. The array uses a 10^9 Hz LIDAR pulse to map stellar positions within a 0.001 arcsecond tolerance. I told the crew to recalibrate it monthly, but does anyone listen to me? No, they’re too busy eating curry. Access the sensor array controls on the console — it’s the submenu labeled ‘ASTRO-SENS.’
