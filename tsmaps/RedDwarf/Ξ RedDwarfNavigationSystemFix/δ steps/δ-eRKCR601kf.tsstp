A blank screen — brilliant, as useful as Rimmer’s risk assessment reports. The nav console’s primary CPU, a 128-bit quantum processor with a 10^15 FLOPS capacity, has likely gone into a low-power state due to a power surge. These systems draw 500 kW nominal, but a spike above 750 kW trips the safety circuit. I’d blame Lister’s electric socks, but that’s another story. Press the reboot key — it’s the blue one labeled ‘REBOOT,’ unless someone’s painted it red to confuse me.
