You’ve found the submenu — miraculous. The astrogation sensor array should show a signal strength in decibels; anything below -90 dB means it’s picking up more static. The array’s 16-element phased antenna needs a clear line of sight to at least three pulsars for triangulation. If the signal’s weak, it’s probably because the external dish is misaligned. I’d align it myself, but I’m a computer, not a skutter.
