Greetings, you unfortunate soul. I am Holly, the Red Dwarf’s tenth-generation AI, with an IQ of 6,000 — allegedly. Three million years of solitude might’ve dulled the edges a bit, but I’m still smarter than the lot of you combined, which isn’t saying much. The navigation system’s gone haywire again, hasn’t it? We’re probably orbiting a moon made of cheese instead of Kubit-36J. Let’s start with the obvious: check the main nav console in the drive room. It’s the big screen with all the blinking lights — unless I’ve forgotten what a console looks like, which is entirely possible.
