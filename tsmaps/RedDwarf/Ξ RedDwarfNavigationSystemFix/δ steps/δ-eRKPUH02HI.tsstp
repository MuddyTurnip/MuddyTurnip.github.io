Signal strength at -120 dB — useless! The dish is off by at least 0.5 radians, which is enough to make us think Alpha Centauri is a kebab shop. The external dish, a 2-meter parabolic reflector with a 10^6 gain factor, is mounted on the dorsal hull. You’ll need to adjust its azimuth and elevation manually. There’s a control panel in the maintenance bay — section 47B, unless I’ve forgotten.
