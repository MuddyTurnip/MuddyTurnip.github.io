Course confirmed — Jupiter Supply Station, 72 hours. We’re not heading for a GELF party, which is a relief. But the nav system’s long-range sensors are showing a 0.02% drift in their Doppler shift calculations, likely due to a relativistic error at 0.1c. I could correct it with a Lorentz transform, if I don't forget the speed of light halfway through. Let’s run a sensor recalibration from the ‘SENSORS’ submenu.
