Dampeners offline — wonderful. The graviton generators, 16 units at 10^10 gravitons/s each, need a power cycle to reset their quantum field matrix. I’d explain the physics, but you’d probably fall asleep. Go to the engineering deck, section 12C, and flip the dampener power switch — it’s the one labeled ‘GRAV-GEN,’ unless I’m thinking of the coffee machine.
