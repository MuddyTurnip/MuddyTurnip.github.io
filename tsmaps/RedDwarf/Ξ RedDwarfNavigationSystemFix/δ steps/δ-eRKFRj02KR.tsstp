You’ve pressed the reboot key — you’re practically a rocket scientist now. The CPU should be cycling through its POST sequence, which takes 47 seconds. You’ll hear a series of beeps — three short, one long — if it’s working. I once rebooted the entire ship by accident and ended up in a dimension where everyone had Rimmer’s personality. Never again.
