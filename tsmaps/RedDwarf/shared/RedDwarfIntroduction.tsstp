# Red Dwarf

*Red Dwarf is a massive, ramshackle interplanetary mining vessel from the British sci-fi comedy series **Red Dwarf**. Picture a hulking, industrial beast—kilometres long, boxy, and battered, with a hull that’s seen better days, painted in a faded red that’s more rust than glamour. It’s a working-class spaceship, built for function over finesse, crawling with corridors, cargo bays, and maintenance decks that feel more like a run-down factory than a sleek sci-fi starship. The interior is a maze of grey, utilitarian bulkheads, flickering lights, and vending machines dispensing questionable curry.*{: .grey}

*Run by the Jupiter Mining Corporation, it’s designed to haul resources across the galaxy, crewed by a mix of technicians, bureaucrats, and service droids. Its AI, Holly, keeps the whole creaking operation together—or barely, depending on the episode—while the ship’s sheer size means entire sections can be forgotten or abandoned. By the first series, it’s already old, clunky, and falling apart, a perfect metaphor for the underdog vibe of the show. It’s less **Enterprise**, more cosmic skip—grimy, chaotic, and oddly loveable.*{: .grey}
