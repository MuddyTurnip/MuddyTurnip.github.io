‘INITIALIZING’ — we’re getting somewhere, though I wouldn’t hold my breath. It’s checking itself. While it’s busy, check the food chute where the grub comes out. If it’s clogged with curry, it’ll refuse to work, like Cat refusing to share a mirror. I told Lister to eat chips, but does he listen? No.
