Heater’s on — brilliant. It should warm the sandwich now. Order another one; it should be toasty this time. I’d say my work here is done, but I might’ve skipped a seven in my calculations — hope that doesn’t poison you. Enjoy your meal, and don’t tell Rimmer I helped; he’ll only complain I didn’t salute the dispenser first. If it breaks again, sort it yourself — I’m off to recalculate pi for the 47th time this century.
