Chute’s clear — well, I’m mildly impressed. The food should come out smoothly now, unless it’s planning a mutiny. The display should say ‘READY,’ meaning it’s done sulking. If it’s still ‘INITIALIZING,’ I might’ve misjudged how long it takes, which wouldn’t be the first time — I once forgot where seven goes in a countdown.
