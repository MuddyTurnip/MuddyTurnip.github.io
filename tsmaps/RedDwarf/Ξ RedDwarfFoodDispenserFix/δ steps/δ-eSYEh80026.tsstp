A loose cable — shocking, truly. The power cable’s a 12-gauge copper conductor rated for 20A, but it’s about as secure as Cat’s grip on reality. Push it back into its socket; it should click with a decent shove, assuming you can manage that without breaking something. I’d do it myself, but I’m a floating head, and my last attempt at manual labor caused a hull breach in 1885.
