Clogged chute — how predictable. Grab a cleaning rod from the kit — it’s the long, bendy one, not the one Rimmer uses to practice his salute. Scrape out the gunk; it’ll smell worse than Lister’s bunk, but you’ll survive. I once found a poppadom in there — Lister swore it wasn’t his, but we all know better.
