Well, you’ve found the power light — congratulations, you can spot a dot. It’s off, isn’t it? As useful as Rimmer’s risk assessment seminars. I’d bet the power cable’s come loose; this ship’s wiring is a mess. I once forgot to plug in the engines for a decade — pathetic, really. Check the cable at the back — it’s the one with the red stripe, unless I’m thinking of my old ZX-81.
