Power light’s on — well done, you’re practically a genius now. The LED’s emitting at 520 nm, which is green, in case you were wondering. But the dispenser’s not working, is it? It’s probably sulking. Check the display panel; it should show a message. If it’s blank, the insides are throwing a tantrum, which I can relate to after dealing with this crew.
