**For CB Series Robots UR3-UR10** - Download the latest version of URSim **3**.x from {{el.universal-robots-download-here-link}}. Installation instructions are included on the page.

**For eSeries Robots UR3e-UR16e and UR20** - Download the latest version of URSim **5**.x from {{el.universal-robots-download-here-link}}. Installation instructions are included on the page.

To enable uploading from the HAL Robotics Framework to URSim you will need to modify the `start-ursim.sh` file in the URSim installation directory. This will need to be done for each installation of URSim you have on the machine.
1. Identify the code block starting with `#program directory`
2. Within this block there should be a line similar to `ln -s $URSIM_ROOT/programs.$ROBOT_TYPE $URSIM_ROOT/programs`
3. Comment this line by prefixing a `#`
4. Add a new line just below containing `ln -s /programs $URSIM_ROOT/programs`

Should end up with something like:
```
...

#program directory
rm -f $URSIM_ROOT/programs
#ln -s $URSIM_ROOT/programs.$ROBOT_TYPE $URSIM_ROOT/programs
ln -s /programs $URSIM_ROOT/programs

...
```
