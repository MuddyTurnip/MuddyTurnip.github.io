### 3. Simulation

#### Objective:

Whilst we expect most users to use our own {{gl.simulation-lc-link}} tools for the majority of their cases, there may be a reason (e.g. cycle time analysis, or validation of the robot's limits) that you want to run your {{gl.procedures-link}} on a manufacturer-provided simulator. This section details what you'll need and how to configure that simulator.

#### Requirements to follow along:

- Windows PC
