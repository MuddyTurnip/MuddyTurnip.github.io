#### How to:

In the Getting Started tutorial we used a preset {{gl.end-effector-link}} from the **Tool** catalog. With the enormous variety of [Tools]{{gl.end-effector-link-D}} in the world and even the ease with which one can create an entirely unique, custom {{gl.end-effector-link}} for a process, chances are good that you will need to model your own {{gl.end-effector-link}} within the HAL Robotics Framework. In this demo we're going to use this pencil holder as an example. The first thing we're going to do is go to the **HAL Robotics** tab, **Cell** panel and select the **Create Tool** component. If you're ever in doubt about where to start, it's often useful to get the component you know you'll need at the end of the chain and work your way backwards. We can see there is an input of _Frame_. As with a {{gl.part-link}} this is the base frame by which the {{gl.end-effector-link}} will be connected to our {{gl.manipulator-link}}. In this particular scenario our {{gl.end-effector-link}} is modelled at the origin and therefore the base frame is the world XY plane. We are then asked for a _Body_. We can import meshes from Rhino or use any generated meshes from within Grasshopper. We also need a _ToolFrame_ or [Tool Centre Point (TCP)]{{gl.endpoint-link-D}}. In a [future tutorial]{{ghl.grasshopper-calibrate-link-D}} we will see how to import that frame from calibration data in your {{gl.controller-link}} but to keep things simple here I'm going to use the point at the tip of the pencil in my model. We need this to be a frame rather than a point but this is simplified because the _ToolFrame_ happens to be aligned with the world XY again. We recommend that the Z axis of [TCPs]{{gl.endpoint-link-D}} point out of the {{gl.end-effector-link}}, following the co-ordinate system flow of the {{gl.manipulator-link}} itself. Once we connect this to the **Tool** component, we will see our {{gl.end-effector-link}} appear with its {{gl.endpoint-tcp-link}} labelled. It's a good habit to hide things as we go to avoid duplicating visualizations. Once the {{gl.end-effector-link}} is completed, we can attach it to our {{gl.manipulator-link}} using the **Attach** component as we did in the [Getting Started tutorial]{{ghl.grasshopper-getting-started-link-D}}. With those assembled we can **Solve** and **Simulate** the {{gl.manipulator-link}} with the {{gl.end-effector-link}} attached.
