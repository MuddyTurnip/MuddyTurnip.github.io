#### Background:

[Tools]{{gl.end-effector-link-D}} can often be approximated to be a single geometric body with a single {{gl.endpoint-link}}. This is the assumption that's made in the {{ghl.grasshopper-create-tool-t-link}} tutorial to make it really easy to get started. There are also plenty of scenarios, however, where the {{gl.end-effector-link}} you have will be composed of multiple {{gl.parts-link}} or even have multiple {{gl.endpoints-link}}.
