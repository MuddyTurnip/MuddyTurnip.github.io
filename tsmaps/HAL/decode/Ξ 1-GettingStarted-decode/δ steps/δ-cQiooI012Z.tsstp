### 1.1. Projects

#### Objective:

In this tutorial we'll see how to create a HAL Robotics _decode_ Project so we can start programming robots.

#### Requirements to follow along:

- HAL Robotics _decode_ installed on a PC. See {{ol.overview-installation-link}} if you need to install the software.

#### Background:

_decode_ will enable you to prepare a complete robot programming environment and we store all of the data associated to that environment in a **Project**. The **Project** is a folder with a series of files, each of which holds different information about the environment you've created or are using.
