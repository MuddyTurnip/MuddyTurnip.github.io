Â¬import ol from "../../../_shared/overviewLinks"


#### Where Next

If you are new to our software, we would recommend starting with the {{ol.overview-installation-link}} tutorial which will get you up and running.

If you already familiar with our software and have our installer loaded, you can re-run it, make sure **include beta** is ticked on, and you'll be ready to go.

Thank you once again for helping to make _decode_ better.
